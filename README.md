Hi there, I’m Kibria Islam

I’m a software engineer with 4+ years of experience focused on backend development using C# and ASP.NET Core, building high-performance and scalable systems.

Currently, I work as a Software Engineer (L2) at Vector360, where I design and deliver robust backend solutions using ASP.NET Core, Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, and MySQL/PostgreSQL. I’ve contributed to multiple full-cycle projects, worked on multi-tenant SaaS platforms, and helped architect systems that scale reliably in production.

My experience spans RESTful API design, microservices, CQRS, background processing, real-time systems, and cloud deployments on AWS and DigitalOcean. I’m also comfortable with DevOps tasks like Linux server management, CI/CD pipelines, Nginx configuration, and performance optimization.

I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean, maintainable code and I’m always eager to learn, share knowledge, and collaborate on meaningful backend projects.
